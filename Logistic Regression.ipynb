    "'''\n",
    "Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables — one independent variable (X) and one dependent\n",
    "variable (Y) — by fitting a straight line to the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model assumes that the relationship between X and Y can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "𝑌=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋+𝜖\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "Y = Dependent (response) variable\n",
    "X = Independent (predictor) variable\n",
    "β0= Intercept (value of Y when 𝑋=0)\n",
    "𝛽1= Slope (change in Y for a one-unit change in X)\n",
    "ϵ = Random error term (captures variations not explained by the model)\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "1.To Understand Relationships:\n",
    "It helps to determine whether and how strongly two variables are related — for example, how study hours (X) affect exam scores (Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.To Predict Outcomes:\n",
    "Once the relationship is established, it can be used to predict the value of the dependent variable for a given value of the independent variable.\n",

    "'''\n",
    "Key Assumptions of Simple Linear Regression (SLR):\n",
    "For Simple Linear Regression to give valid and reliable results, several assumptions must be satisfied. These assumptions ensure that the relationship\n",
    "between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is properly modeled by a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Linearity:\n",
    "The relationship between X and Y should be linear — meaning that changes in X result in proportional changes in Y.\n",
    "Mathematically:\n",
    "            𝐸(𝑌∣𝑋)=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋\n",
    "How to check: Use scatter plots or residual plots. If the data points roughly form a straight line, the linearity assumption holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Independence of Errors:\n",
    "The residuals (errors) should be independent of each other.\n",
    "In other words, the value of one residual should not depend on another.\n",
    "Why it matters: Violation often occurs in time-series data, leading to misleading results.\n",
    "How to check: Use the Durbin–Watson test or inspect residual plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors):\n",
    "The variance of the error terms (ϵ) should be constant across all levels of X.\n",
    "That is, the spread of residuals should be roughly the same for all values of X.\n",
    "If violated: This is called heteroscedasticity, which can make predictions unreliable.\n",
    "How to check: Plot residuals vs. predicted values — the spread should look uniform.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Normality of Errors:\n",
    "The residuals should be normally distributed (especially important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals).\n",
    "How to check:\n",
    "  * Use a histogram or Q-Q plot of residuals.\n",
    "  * Apply Shapiro–Wilk test or Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity (in SLR context: X is not constant):\n",
    "In SLR, since there’s only one independent variable, it must vary — i.e., it should not be constant.\n",
    "If X doesn’t change, the model cannot estimate the slope (𝛽1).'''\n"

    "                                     𝑌=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑋+𝜖\n",

    "1. Intercept (𝛽0)\n",
    "*The intercept represents the predicted value of Y when 𝑋=0.\n",
    "*It is the point where the regression line crosses the Y-axis.\n",
    "*Interpretation:\n",
    "   When the independent variable X is 0, the expected value of Y is 𝛽0\n",

    "If the regression equation is:\n",
    "                             𝑌=30+4𝑋\n",
    "Then when 𝑋=0, 𝑌=30.\n",

    "2. Slope (𝛽1)\n",
    "*The slope represents the change in Y for a one-unit increase in X.\n",
    "*It tells us the direction and strength of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "*For every 1-unit increase in X, the predicted value of Y changes by 𝛽1 units (increases if positive, decreases if negative).\n",
